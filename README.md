MTB 
Designed with shock-absorbing features and sturdy builds, mountain bikes can handle dirt trails and the rocks, roots, bumps and ruts that make them so fun. Mountain bikes have lower gears than road bikes so you can ride up steeper terrain.
Two frequently used terms are “full suspension,” meaning a bike has both front and rear suspension, and “hardtail,” meaning a bike has only a suspension fork. Full-suspension models tend to be more expensive, but they offer better traction and a more comfortable ride. They can also handle more varied terrain.

Cross-country bikes: Lightweight and responsive, this style of mountain bike originated in the racing world, so it delivers both riding speed and climbing prowess. It’s a good choice if you want to ride off road on your fitness rides or if you want a nimbler bike for less-technical local trails.

Trail bikes: This is the style most new mountain bikers will get. If social trail riding with friends on beginner-friendly trails and dirt roads is your goal, then this is your bike. Bikes in this category place equal emphasis on fun and efficiency.

All-mountain bikes: These bikes are a good option as you progress to riding on more technical terrain. All-mountain bikes are well-rounded performers: joyful on steep and flowing descents, while also being capable climbers. Their geometry balances the need for both uphill power and downhill stability, so all-mountain bikes can handle a variety of technical features along the trail.

Fat-tire bikes: Recognizable because of their oversize tires, these bikes offer outsize traction that makes it possible for you to ride them on sand or snow. The ultra-wide tires are also reassuringly forgiving on all sorts of rough terrain.

Hybrid/Fitness Bikes
If you want something that performs well on the street but can also handle some unpaved terrain, this is your bike. You might also see hybrid bikes referred to as "fitness bikes" because their comfort and versatility appeal to riders motivated primarily by the exercise benefits of riding. Hybrid bikes generally have a more upright riding position than their road bike counterparts. Most have large-diameter road wheels for speed, paired with wider tires for off-road traction.
A tipoff to whether a bike is more for street riding is the absence of suspension. Hybrid bikes with front suspension are a good choice if you plan to spend more time off road—the tradeoff is a bit more weight and a little less speed in exchange for a cushier ride.


Cruiser bikes: Cruiser bikes are built for leisurely rides around your neighborhood or vacation home. Cruiser bikes feature wider tires for traction and cushioning, a comfortable seat and a relaxed sitting position. They’re fun for short rides on flat, paved surfaces.

Cargo bikes: Featuring beefy builds so you can haul lots of gear and handle tons of weight, cargo bikes are ideal for running errands and transporting kids. Neither speedy nor nimble, these are highly utilitarian bikes. Read more on How to Use a Cargo Bike.


Folding bikes: These bikes can be folded up and placed in a carrying bag, which makes them handy for commuters with limited storage space at home or the office. Lightweight, strong and able to be folded up quickly, they’re also a good choice if you want to travel with your bike.
